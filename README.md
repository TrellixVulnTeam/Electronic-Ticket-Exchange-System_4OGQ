### Problem Statement 
ETES is a new competitor to TicketMaster where Bay Area event ticket holder can post their tickets for sale. Buyer will be able to search for an event and see which tickets are available from the ticket holder. When buyer selects posted event tickets, ETES will proceed with the check-out process. ETES will charge 5% of the sale price to the buyer and seller. The ticket will be pickup and deliver from the seller address to the buyer address using UBER liked services. You can calculate how long it takes to deliver that package (use Google Map services to get the driving time and distance) assuming the UBER driver will show at your door within 1 hour of the purchase.

You are responsible to develop the IT infrastructure and website for both buyers and sellers. Seller will post a fixed price on each set of tickets. You need to keep track of buyer and seller information in the database as well as the ticket transaction. Unlike the shopping cart model, each transaction is for a single event only.
